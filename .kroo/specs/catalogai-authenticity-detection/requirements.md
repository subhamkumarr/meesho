# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CatalogAI - Authenticity Detection is a production-ready MVP system that flags AI-generated/synthetic product images and guides sellers to improve their listings. The system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze uploaded images and classify them as authentic, suspicious, or synthetic, helping reduce misrepresentation in product catalogs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a seller, I want to upload product images and get authenticity feedback, so that I can ensure my listings meet marketplace standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads one or more images THEN the system SHALL process each image within 2-5 seconds on CPU
2. WHEN an image is processed THEN the system SHALL return a classification label (authentic/suspicious/synthetic) with confidence score
3. WHEN an image is flagged as suspicious or synthetic THEN the system SHALL provide actionable improvement suggestions
4. IF an uploaded image exceeds 8MB THEN the system SHALL reject it with an appropriate error message
5. WHEN multiple images are uploaded simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them in parallel and return results for each

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to calibrate detection thresholds, so that I can optimize the system's accuracy for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the threshold configuration page THEN the system SHALL display current threshold values for authentic and synthetic classifications
2. WHEN an admin updates threshold values THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately without requiring a restart
3. WHEN threshold changes are made THEN the system SHALL provide a live preview showing how sample images would be reclassified
4. WHEN an admin triggers model retraining THEN the system SHALL use seed data to retrain the classifier and return accuracy metrics
5. IF threshold values are invalid (outside 0-1 range) THEN the system SHALL reject the update with validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an auditor, I want to review scan history, so that I can track system usage and verify decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a scan is performed THEN the system SHALL persist the scan record with timestamp, filename, score, label, and reasoning
2. WHEN accessing the audit trail THEN the system SHALL display paginated scan history with filtering capabilities
3. WHEN viewing scan details THEN the system SHALL show feature analysis and decision reasoning
4. WHEN the audit log grows large THEN the system SHALL support infinite scroll or pagination for performance
5. IF a scan record is corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully without breaking the audit view

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I can integrate the system with other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing /docs THEN the system SHALL provide interactive OpenAPI documentation
2. WHEN using the API THEN all endpoints SHALL return consistent JSON responses with proper HTTP status codes
3. WHEN an API error occurs THEN the system SHALL return descriptive error messages with appropriate status codes
4. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL support CORS for frontend integration
5. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 status with retry information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want containerized deployment, so that I can run the application consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `docker compose up --build` THEN the system SHALL start both backend and frontend services
2. WHEN the system starts for the first time THEN it SHALL automatically train the initial model using seed data
3. WHEN the application is running THEN it SHALL be accessible at http://localhost:3000
4. WHEN containers restart THEN the system SHALL preserve model artifacts and database state
5. IF model artifacts are missing THEN the system SHALL automatically retrain on startup

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want explainable AI features, so that I can understand and improve the detection algorithm.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is classified THEN the system SHALL extract interpretable features (edge density, color statistics, compression artifacts, noise patterns)
2. WHEN providing classification results THEN the system SHALL include human-readable reasons for the decision
3. WHEN features are anomalous THEN the system SHALL map technical metrics to plain-English explanations
4. WHEN model performance is evaluated THEN the system SHALL provide accuracy metrics and confusion matrix data
5. IF feature extraction fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and provide fallback classification

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want automated testing, so that I can ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the CI pipeline SHALL run linting, type checking, and unit tests
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL cover core functionality including feature extraction and classification
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL verify both backend and frontend compile successfully
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the CI SHALL prevent deployment and provide clear error messages
5. IF dependencies have security vulnerabilities THEN the CI SHALL flag them for review

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an end user, I want clear guidance on image authenticity, so that I can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is classified as synthetic THEN the system SHALL display "Needs Real Proof" with specific improvement suggestions
2. WHEN an image is classified as suspicious THEN the system SHALL display "Looks Suspicious" with guidance on adding more authentic photos
3. WHEN an image is classified as authentic THEN the system SHALL display "Verified" with confirmation messaging
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL include a disclaimer that human review is recommended
5. IF classification confidence is low THEN the system SHALL emphasize the need for manual verification
